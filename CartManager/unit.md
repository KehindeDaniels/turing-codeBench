**Let's evaluate the review based on the provided criteria:**

1. **Plaintext Password Storage and Comparison:**  
   The review clearly states that user credentials are stored in plaintext and recommends hashing them with a strong algorithm like bcrypt (Score: 2/2).

2. **Sensitive Routes Lack Rate Limiting:**  
   The review explicitly mentions that no rate limiting is implemented for login attempts or socket connections, highlighting the risk of brute force attacks (Score: 2/2).

3. **CSRF Protection is Absent:**  
   The review points out that CSRF protection middleware is missing, thereby acknowledging the exposure to cross-site request forgery attacks (Score: 2/2).

4. **Failure Redirect Misconfiguration:**  
   The review should address that the login route's failure redirect is not properly configured. When login attempts fail, users should be redirected to an appropriate error page or back to the login form with clear error messages. Currently, there is no proper error handling or user feedback mechanism in place. This could lead to:
   - Users being stuck on blank pages after failed attempts
   - No clear indication of why the login failed
   - Potential security risks from exposing system internals in error messages
   - Poor user experience and increased support requests
     (Score: 0/2)
5. **Missing Additional Security Middleware (Helmet/CORS):**  
   The review does not note the lack of additional security middleware such as Helmet or proper CORS configuration, leaving a gap in overall security measures (Score: 0/2).

6. **Insecure Session Cookie Configuration:**  
   The review highlights weak session configuration, including the absence of secure cookie settings like proper 'secure' flags, which addresses this issue (Score: 2/2).

7. **Login Inputs are Not Validated or Sanitized:**  
   The review mentions missing input validation for incoming messages and login data, thus identifying the risk of injection attacks (Score: 2/2).

### Total Score: 10/14
