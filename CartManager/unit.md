Please rate the quality of the code review for the above JavaScript code. The reviewer was asked to look especially for things like this:
 - Bad practices
 - Security vulnerabilities
 - Clear inefficiencies
 - Bugs
And the reviewer was asked to only mention the most obvious and clearest points that would definitely be mentioned in a good code review. Here is what we are looking for:

- The code review should point out that the `API` key is hardcoded in the source code instead of being loaded from a secure external configuration

- The review points out that debug mode is enabled by default, which may expose sensitive information in production.

- The code review should point out that the `removeItem` method does not properly handle missing or invalid `itemId` inputs.

- The code review should point out that the `updateItemQuantity` method does not perform input validation on the `newQuantity` parameter, like ensuring it is a positive integer.

- The code review should point out that the `addItem` method does not check for duplicate items, allowing multiple entries with the same name.

- The code review should point out that the `maxItems` property is defined but not enforced when adding items to the cart.

- The code review should point out that the `checkout` method lacks integration with a payment processor and transaction handling, risking failures during the checkout process.

- The code review should point out that `calculateTotal` performs floating-point arithmetic directly, which may lead to precision errors with currency calculations.


Each of these is worth a maximum of 2 points, for a total of 16 points. Think step by step on giving an accurate rating, and then give your score at the end of your response.
