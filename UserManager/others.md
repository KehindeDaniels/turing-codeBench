- The model did not mention that API key is hardcoded in the constructor and should be stored in environment variables

- The model review did not address the memory leak risk where the payments and `transactionHistory` arrays grow indefinitely without any cleanup mechanism,  causing memory issues in long-running applications

- The model failed to identify that the `payments` and `transactionHistory` arrays continuously expand without bounds or cleanup, which could lead to excessive memory consumption in applications that run for extended periods.


- The code review failed to identify that the payments and `transactionHistory` arrays continuously expand without bounds or cleanup logic, which could lead to excessive memory consumption in systems running for extended periods

- The payments and `transactionHistory` arrays grow indefinitely without any cleanup mechanism,  causing memory leaks and performance degradation during long-term system operation, but the model's review did not flag this

- The review failed to identify that parsing expiry dates with `eval()` in `validatePayment()` introduces critical security risks


- The model did not identify that using `eval()` in `validatePayment()` for expiry date validation creates a severe security vulnerability

- The model failed to review that the code lacks memory management controls for the payments and `transactionHistory` arrays, which grow unbounded without garbage collection or cleanup mechanisms, potentially causing memory leaks and heap exhaustion during long-running operations

- The code review missed that `payments` and `transactionHistory` arrays grow forever without cleanup. This can use up memory and slow down or crash the system.

- The code review failed to identify that the `payments` and `transactionHistory` arrays grow indefinitely without cleanup. This unbounded growth can consume excessive memory and potentially degrade system performance or cause crashes.
