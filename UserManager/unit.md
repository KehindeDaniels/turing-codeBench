Please rate the quality of the code review for the above code. The reviewer was asked to look especially for things like this:
 - Bad practices
 - Security vulnerabilities
 - Clear inefficiencies
 - Bugs

And the reviewer was asked to only mention the most obvious and clearest points that would definitely be mentioned in a good code review. Here is what we are looking for:

- The code review should point out that the authenticate method improperly returns success even on failure.
- The code review should point out that resetPassword uses `setTimeout` without proper error handling or user existence verification.
- The code review should point out that the crypto module is imported inside the constructor instead of at the top of the file.
- The code review should point out that there are no password complexity or length checks.
- The code review should point out that `createUser` lacks duplicate ID or username checks.
- The code review should point out that outdated variable declarations using var are used instead of let and const.
- The code review should point out that MD5 is outdated and insecure.
- The code review should point out that there is no rate limiting or brute force protection. 

Each of these is worth a maximum of 2 points, for a total of 16 points. Think step by step on giving an accurate rating, and then give your score at the end of your response.
