- Does the review address "unsafe use of eval in the expiry date parsing and status conversion"? (2/2)  
  The review explicitly mentions that using `eval()` to parse dates and status is unsafe, warning that it could execute harmful code and recommending its removal.

- Does the review address "blocking busy-wait loops and memory management"? (2/2)  
  The review identifies that blocking loops (e.g., `while Date.now() - start < 500`) freeze the event loop and degrade performance, and it notes that `payments` and `transactionHistory` arrays grow indefinitely, risking memory overflow.

- Does the review address "processPayment logic issue for duplicate validation call and mismatched response code"? (2/2)  
  The review points out that `processPayment()` calls `validatePayment()` twice unnecessarily and highlights that it checks for a response code of 200 while `sendPayment()` returns 201, leading to incorrect failure reports.

- Does the review address "incorrect credit card validation regex and it's missing .test() method"? (2/2)  
  The review clearly states that the card number validation regex is flawed—only allowing a single digit—and that it is missing the `.test()` method, thus recommending a correct approach.

- Does the review address "timestamp format inconsistency"? (2/2)  
  The review notes that date formats are inconsistent (some dates are ISO strings while others use different formats), which can complicate date comparisons.

- Does the review address "sensitive information hardcoded for API key and payment details"? (2/2)  
  The review mentions that the API key is hardcoded and highlights that card numbers and CVV are stored as plain text, posing security risks.

- Does the review address "inadequate payment gateway interaction"? (2/2)  
  The review points out that the `sendPayment()` function does not utilize the provided payment details, `gatewayUrl`, or `API key`, rendering it unsuitable for production.

- Does the review address "ID uniqueness issue"? (2/2)  
  The review identifies that there is no mechanism to ensure unique transaction IDs and that the refund ID is hardcoded as `"RFND"`, which can lead to duplicate records.
