```
- No Authentication/Authorization – The upload endpoint isn’t protected, allowing anyone (including unauthorized users) to upload files.
No File Type Validation – The code does not validate the file type or extension, so malicious files (e.g. .php, .exe, .js) can be uploaded.
No File Size Limit – There are no size checks or limits, meaning very large files can be uploaded, potentially causing memory exhaustion or denial of service.
Filename Not Sanitized (Path Traversal) – The original filename is used directly in path.join without sanitization, enabling an attacker to upload with a name like ../../etc/passwd to write files outside the intended directory or overwrite files.
Publicly Accessible Uploads – Files are stored in a public directory that the server serves statically. This means uploaded files can be directly accessed via URL by anyone, which is a security risk (exposing sensitive files or hosting malicious content).
Logging Sensitive Data – The application logs user information and file names/paths (potentially sensitive data). This could leak information or be exploited (e.g. if an attacker includes malicious content in the filename, it will be written to the log).
Blocking Synchronous I/O – The upload handler performs blocking file system operations (existsSync, mkdirSync, appendFileSync, statSync) inside the request, which will block the event loop and degrade performance under load.
Inefficient and Unsafe Handling (Global State) – The code has inefficiencies and race conditions: it redundantly processes the file (e.g. reading file stats immediately after starting an async save, duplicating the upload record twice) and uses global state (currentUpload, uploads array) that could lead to inconsistent data or race conditions if multiple uploads occur concurrently.


Below is the unit test (evaluation criteria) phrasing for the LLM’s code review response. Use this in the separate unit test field to evaluate the review:

---

**Introduction:**

```
Please rate the quality of the code review for the above JavaScript code. The reviewer was asked to look especially for things like:
 - Bad practices
 - Security vulnerabilities
 - Clear inefficiencies
 - Bugs
And the reviewer was asked to mention only the most obvious and clearest points that would definitely be included in a good code review. Here is what we are looking for:
```

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- The code review should point out that the upload endpoint has no authentication or authorization, allowing any user to upload files. 
- The code review should point out that there is no file type validation, which permits dangerous file types  `.exe`, `.php`, or `.js` to be uploaded 
- The code review should point out that there is no file size limit, exposing the system to potential denial-of-service attacks via large file uploads 
- The code review should point out that the filename is used without sanitization, leading to potential path traversal vulnerabilities like a filename like `../../etc/passwd` 
- The code review should point out that files are stored in a publicly accessible directory, which could expose uploaded files to unauthorized access 
- The code review should point out that sensitive data like file names, user identifiers, and file paths is being logged, potentially exposing this information in logs 
- The code review should point out that blocking synchronous I/O operations like the `fs.existsSync`, `fs.mkdirSync`, `fs.appendFileSync`, and `fs.statSync` are used in the request handler, which can block the event loop and degrade performance 
- The code review should point out that the use of global state like the `currentUpload` variable and the duplicate entries in the `uploads` array introduces inefficiencies and potential race conditions under concurrent access

This set of criteria outlines the 8 major points that must be identified in a comprehensive code review of the provided file upload system.
