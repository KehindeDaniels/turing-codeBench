### Prompt

You are tasked with fixing the OAuth2 token refresh functionality in our web application. This module is responsible for checking if the current access token is near expiry and, if so, refreshing it by calling an external endpoint. The current implementation has several critical issues:

1. **Expiry Timing Check:**  
   The token refresh is triggered using a timing check that may be off by one—resulting in refreshing too early or too late. The logic must accurately determine when the token is nearly expired (i.e., less than 1 second remaining).

2. **Concurrency Issues:**  
   There is no mechanism to prevent multiple simultaneous refresh operations. When several API calls occur concurrently as the token nears expiration, they can all trigger a refresh, resulting in multiple token updates. This must be controlled so that only one refresh occurs, with all requests using the same updated token.

3. **Error Handling:**  
   If the refresh process fails (for example, due to a network error), the function currently throws an error. Instead, it should handle the error more gracefully to prevent cascading failures across the application.

4. **Token Propagation:**  
   The refresh logic does not consistently update both the access token and refresh token in the global state, which may leave parts of the application using outdated credentials.

Your goal is to fix these issues so that:
- The token is refreshed precisely when needed, without premature or delayed operations.
- Only one refresh operation is executed even under high concurrent load.
- Errors during refresh are managed without causing application-wide crashes.
- Both the access token and refresh token are updated in a synchronized manner for consistent application-wide use.
