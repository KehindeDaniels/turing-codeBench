- The code review should point out that the eval endpoint accepts raw code from the user without any restrictions.  

- The code review should point out that error details from the eval endpoint are exposed directly to the client.  

- The code review should point out that the admin endpoint relies on a hard-coded password passed via query parameters for authentication.  

- The code review should point out that the admin endpoint lacks access restrictions, leading to potential security issues.  

- The code review should point out that SQL queries are constructed using string concatenation rather than parameterized queries.  

- The code review should point out that the application uses the deprecated body-parser package instead of Expressâ€™s built-in middleware.  

- The code review should point out that there is no rate limiting or throttling implemented, leaving the application vulnerable to brute force or DoS attacks.  

- The code review should point out that the code does not implement any form of secure error handling middleware, resulting in potentially sensitive error information being exposed.
