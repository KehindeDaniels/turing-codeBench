Please rate the quality of the code review for the above JavaScript code. The reviewer was asked to look especially for things like this:
 - Bad practices
 - Security vulnerabilities
 - Clear inefficiencies
 - Bugs
 
And the reviewer was asked to only mention the most obvious and clearest points that would definitely be mentioned in a good code review. Here is what we are looking for:


- The code review should point out that the eval endpoint accepts raw code from the user without any restrictions.  

- The code review should point out that error details from the eval endpoint are exposed directly to the client.  

- The code review should point out that the admin endpoint relies on a hard-coded password passed via query parameters for authentication.  

- The code review should point out that the admin endpoint lacks access restrictions, leading to potential security issues.  

- The code review should point out that SQL queries are constructed using string concatenation rather than parameterized queries.  

- The code review should point out that the application uses the deprecated body-parser package instead of Expressâ€™s built-in middleware.  

- The code review should point out that there is no rate limiting or throttling implemented, leaving the application vulnerable to brute force or DoS attacks.  

- The code review should point out that the code does not implement any form of secure error handling middleware, resulting in potentially sensitive error information being exposed.  


Each of these is worth a maximum of 2 points, for a total of 16 points. Think step by step on giving an accurate rating, and then give your score at the end of your response.
