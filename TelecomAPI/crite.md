**Let's evaluate the review based on the provided criteria:**

1. **The eval endpoint accepts raw code from the user without any restrictions.**  
The review states that the `/evaluate` endpoint uses `eval()` on user input and notes the risk of arbitrary code execution, implying that raw code is accepted without restrictions.  
Score: 2/2

2. **Error details from the eval endpoint are exposed directly to the client.**  
The review discusses generic error messages and overall error handling issues but does not specifically mention that error details from the eval endpoint are exposed to the client.  
Score: 0/2

3. **The admin endpoint relies on a hard-coded password passed via query parameters for authentication.**  
The review mentions insecure authentication with hardcoded admin credentials but does not explicitly state that the password is passed via query parameters.  
Score: 1/2

4. **The admin endpoint lacks access restrictions, leading to potential security issues.**  
The review does not address the absence of pagination or additional access restrictions on the admin endpoint.  
Score: 0/2

5. **SQL queries are constructed using string concatenation rather than parameterized queries.**  
The review clearly identifies that SQL queries are built using string concatenation and recommends parameterized queries to mitigate SQL injection risks.  
Score: 2/2

6. **The application uses the deprecated body-parser package instead of Express’s built-in middleware.**  
The review does not mention the deprecated body-parser package or suggest using Express’s built-in middleware (`express.json()`).  
Score: 0/2

7. **There is no rate limiting or throttling implemented, leaving the application vulnerable to brute force or DoS attacks.**  
The review does not mention any lack of rate limiting or throttling in the application.  
Score: 0/2

8. **The code does not implement any form of secure error handling middleware, resulting in potentially sensitive error information being exposed.**  
The review discusses generic error messages and the need for proper error handling middleware, indicating insecure error handling practices.  
Score: 2/2

**Total Score: 7/16**
