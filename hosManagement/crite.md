Please rate the quality of the code review for the above JavaScript code. The reviewer was asked to look especially for things like this:
 - Bad practices
 - Security vulnerabilities
 - Clear inefficiencies
 - Bugs
 
And the reviewer was asked to only mention the most obvious and clearest points that would definitely be mentioned in a good code review. Here is what we are looking for:


- The code review should point out that middleware functions must call `next()` on all code paths to avoid hanging requests, as seen in the custom middleware that never calls `next()` when the “x-custom” header is not set.

- The review should point out that code that blocks the server, like the infinite loop in /records, needs to be fixed so the server keeps working.

- The review should point out that showing private config data through endpoints like `/config` is unsafe since it lacks proper auth checks.

- The review should point out that using deeply nested callbacks for reading patient records is bad practice and should use `async/await` or Promises instead for better code readability and error handling

- The review should point out that not having security middleware makes the system unsafe, which is very risky for a hospital system.

- The code review should point out that deprecated file system methods, such as `fs.exists` in the `/deprecated` endpoint, should be replaced with `fs.access` or `fs.promises.access` which are the current best practices for checking file existence

- The review should point out that header values like "x-custom" need to be checked and cleaned to stop security problems.

- The review should point out that package conflicts need to be fixed, since the code uses a router (patientRouter) that doesn't exist and may have wrong package versions

Each of these is worth a maximum of 2 points, for a total of 16 points. Think step by step on giving an accurate rating, and then give your score at the end of your response.
