1. A critical security vulnerability was overlooked in the review - the `/config` endpoint exposes sensitive information including database credentials, API keys, and server configurations, potentially enabling malicious actors to compromise the system.

2. The security assessment failed to identify that the `/config` endpoint leaks confidential data such as database passwords, API keys, and server parameters, creating a significant security risk for system breaches.

3. A major security flaw was missed in the review: the `/config` endpoint shows sensitive data like database passwords, API keys, and server settings, making the system open to attacks.
4. The review team missed a crucial security weakness where sensitive information (database passwords, API keys, server configurations) is exposed through the `/config` endpoint, potentially facilitating system intrusion.

5. The security review missed a big problem - the `/config` endpoint shows private data like database passwords, API keys, and server settings. This makes the system unsafe and easy to attack.


1. The code review overlooks several nested callback patterns in the codebase, especially within patient record management code. This anti-pattern should have been flagged with recommendations for contemporary async/await approaches.

2. Multiple deeply nested callbacks were missed during review, particularly in patient data processing. The assessment should have noted these problematic patterns and proposed modern asynchronous solutions.

3. The review team failed to catch numerous instances of callback nesting, most notably in patient record operations. These anti-patterns warranted identification and suggestions for current asynchronous programming practices.

4. Several cases of excessive callback nesting went unnoticed in the review, specifically in patient information handling. These problematic patterns should have been identified with recommendations for modern async implementations.

5. The assessment overlooked multiple callback nesting issues throughout the codebase, predominantly in patient record processing. These anti-patterns needed to be highlighted with proposals for contemporary asynchronous coding methods.






The review failed to point out that the middleware functions don't use `next()` when they should. This makes requests get stuck and time out. Middleware needs to call next() everywhere unless it's meant to end the request.
