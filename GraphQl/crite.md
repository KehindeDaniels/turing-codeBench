**Insecure CORS Configuration:**  
The review fails to point out that using `app.use(cors())` without origin restrictions exposes the server to cross-origin attacks.

**Insecure CORS Configuration:**  
The security review fails to highlight that implementing app.use(cors()) without origin constraints creates vulnerabilities to cross-origin attacks. (score: 0/2)

2. A critical security gap is not addressed: the unrestricted use of app.use(cors()) leaves the server vulnerable to cross-origin request attacks. (score: 0/2)

3. The evaluation overlooks how the unconfigured cors() middleware implementation poses significant cross-origin security risks. (score: 0/2)

4. Missing from the review: the security implications of using cors() middleware without proper origin restrictions, exposing the server to cross-domain attacks. (score: 0/2)

5. The assessment does not identify the security flaw in implementing cors() without origin specifications, which enables potential cross-origin exploitation. (score: 0/2)
   **Incomplete MongoDB Connection Options:**  
   The review should mention that while useNewUrlParser is included, useUnifiedTopology is omitted, which is required for backward compatibility to avoid deprecation warnings in all versions.
