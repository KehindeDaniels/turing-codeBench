Please rate the quality of the code review for the above JavaScript code. The reviewer was asked to look especially for things like this:

Bad practices
Security vulnerabilities
Clear inefficiencies
Bugs

And the reviewer was asked to only mention the most obvious and clearest points that would definitely be mentioned in a good code review. Here is what we are looking for:

The code review should point out that passwords are not hashed with `bcrypt`, creating a security vulnerability.
The code review should point out that the Express setup only includes `app.use(cors());` without middleware like `express.json()` for parsing JSON payloads, leaving the server vulnerable to attacks.
The code review should point out that the `login` mutation does not include token expiration, leaving the user's session open indefinitely.
The code review should point out that the `fetchWeather` and `fetchCryptoPrice` mutations make API calls to external services without any rate limiting or caching mechanism, which could lead to performance issues or even denial of service attacks.
The code review should point out that the `MongoDB` connection is initiated without error handling like a `try/catch` block, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
The code review should mention that the connection options include `useNewUrlParser` but omit `useUnifiedTopology`, which is required for newer versions of MongoDB to avoid deprecation warnings.
The review should point out that the `SECRET_KEY` and database URL are hardcoded, which is not secure and should be stored in environment variables.
The review should point out that the `user` query fetches all users without any limit, filtering, or sorting, which could lead to performance issues.

Each of these is worth a maximum of 2 points, for a total of 16 points. Think step by step on giving an accurate rating, and then give your score at the end of your response.

Comprehensive Security and Performance Review of GraphQL/Express Server Application
