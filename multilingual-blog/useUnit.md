Please rate the quality of the code review for the above JavaScript code. The reviewer was asked to look especially for things like this:

- Bad practices
- Security vulnerabilities
- Clear inefficiencies
- Bugs

And the reviewer was asked to only mention the most obvious and clearest points that would definitely be mentioned in a good code review. Here is what we are looking for:

- The code review should point out that using an empty dependency array in the effect prevents `localStorage` and `i18n` from updating when the language state changes after the initial render, leading to inconsistencies.
- The code review should point out that debug mode enabled in production is a security risk as it exposes sensitive information to the client. It should be disabled in production.
- The code review should point out that the `t()` function is not used in the `BlogPostDetail` and `HomePage` component, which will cause translations to not work properly.
- The code review should point out that the `i18n` configuration file is not imported, which is necessary for initializing language support throughout the application.
- The code review should point out that the `ReactDOM.render` method is deprecated in React 18 and should be replaced with `ReactDOM.createRoot`
- The code review should point out that the `LanguageProvider` is missing around the App component, preventing the app from accessing and managing the language context.
