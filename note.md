# 1
- The model fails because it directly mutates the user object. So, If a user is flagged as isLocked, that state persists for subsequent login attempts, even if the login is successful

## 2.
- The code fails because in the `verifyTwoFActor`, the user is directly mutated `user.isLocked = true`, and since `this.users.find(...)` returns a reference to the original user object inside the users array, wser will always be locked and future successful login will fail, returning undefined for a successful `twoFactor`

## 3.
- The code fails because it directly modifies the user object, any update to isLocked will remains, which is affecting subsequent login calls regardless of other factors and always returning undefined even for a successful login


```javascript
 ● Enhancing AuthService with two-factor authentication › Multiple failed 2FA attempts do not lock until 3rd consecutive fail (single device)

    expect(received).toMatch(expected)

    Expected pattern: /locked/i
    Received string:  "Incorrect 2FA code."

      219 |     let fail3 = auth.verifyTwoFactor("Ajiboye", "deviceA", "222222");
      220 |     expect(fail3.success).toBe(false);
    > 221 |     expect(fail3.message).toMatch(/locked/i);        
          |                           ^
      222 |
      223 |     // Even the correct code won't help now
      224 |     let postLock = auth.verifyTwoFactor("Ajiboye", "deviceA", code);

      at Object.toMatch (authService.test.js:221:27)
```
## 4.
- The code fails because, even though it locks the user (if (failedCount >= 3)), it does not update the message to reflect the account lock on the 3rd failure. Instead, it still returns the "Incorrect 2FA code" message


```javascript
● Enhancing AuthService with two-factor authentication › Multiple failed 2FA attempts do not lock until 3rd consecutive fail (single device)

    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality        

    Expected: false
    Received: true

      224 |     // Even the correct code won't help now
      225 |     let postLock = auth.verifyTwoFactor("Ajiboye", "deviceA", code);
    > 226 |     expect(postLock.success).toBe(false);
          |                              ^
      227 |     expect(postLock.message).toMatch(/locked/i);     
      228 |   });
      229 |

```

- The code fails due to wrong logic in the `consecutiveFailures` counter; it should check for account lock when consecutiveFailures is greater than or equal to 3, not 2

- The code fails because after checking `if (user.consecutiveFailures >= 3)`, the code does not update the message to indicate the account is locked. Instead, it continues to return the message for an incorrect 2FA code ('Incorrect 2FA code'), even when the account should be locked.

    expect(received).toBeUndefined()

    Received: null

      54 |     // The code should be cleared for deviceA after successful verification
      55 |     const postVerify = auth.twoFactorStore.get("Ajiboye")?.["deviceA"];
    > 56 |     expect(postVerify).toBeUndefined();
         |                        ^
      57 |   });

      59 |   test("Incorrect 2FA code (single device)", () => {

```
- The model fails because it does not properly remove the 2FA code from the store, instead of completely deleting the code, it sets the value to null, making the code to still remain in the store with a null value.



```javascript
 ● Enhancing AuthService with two-factor authentication › Multiple failed 2FA attempts do not lock until 3rd consecutive fail (single device)

    expect(received).toMatch(expected)

    Expected pattern: /locked/i
    Received string:  "Incorrect 2FA code."

      220 |     let fail3 = auth.verifyTwoFactor("Ajiboye", "deviceA", "222222");
      221 |     expect(fail3.success).toBe(false);
    > 222 |     expect(fail3.message).toMatch(/locked/i);        
          |                           ^
      223 |
      224 |     // Even the correct code won't help now

```

- The code fails because, after locking the user upon multiple failed attempt, it does not update the message to reflect the account lock on the 3rd failure. Instead, it still returns the "Incorrect 2FA code" message
