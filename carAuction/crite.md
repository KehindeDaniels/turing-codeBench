Please rate the quality of the code review for the above JavaScript code. The reviewer was asked to look especially for things like this:

- Bad practices
- Security vulnerabilities
- Clear inefficiencies
- Bugs
  And the reviewer was asked to only mention the most obvious and clearest points that would definitely be mentioned in a good code review. Here is what we are looking for:

- The review should point out that the JWT verification logic is duplicated in multiple routes. This repetition can lead to inconsistencies and maintenance challenges. Instead, use middleware to centralize token authentication and role checking.

- The review should point out that the database path and JSON Web Token are hardcoded in the code. They should be stored in environment variables or configuration files for better security and flexibility.

- The review should point out that error handling is inconsistent as each endpoint implements its own error responses and logging, resulting in varying levels of detail, instead of a unified, centralized error-handling approach.

- The review should point out that there is no consistent enforcement of authentication and authorization across endpoints, The `/api/bid/:carId` endpoint only verifies the JWT without confirming that the associated user is valid, while the `/api/createCar` endpont lack any authentication checks altogether.

- The review should point out that the application imports the body-parser package but fails to implement it through middleware configuration (`app.use(bodyParser.json())` or `app.use(express.json())`). This prevents proper parsing of JSON request bodies, resulting in undefined `req.body` values.

- The code review should point out that the passwords are stored in plain text, which is highly insecure. Instead, it should use a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt to store passwords.

Each of these is worth a maximum of 2 points, for a total of 16 points. Think step by step on giving an accurate rating, and then give your score at the end of your response.

4. **Password Storage:**
   The review expressly points out that the `register` endpoint stores passwords in plain text, which is highly insecure. Instead, it should use a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt to store passwords.ds.

5. **Password Storage:**
   The review expressly points out that the passwords arestored in plain text, which is highly insecure, and suggested using bcrypt for secure password storage.
   **Score: 2/2**
6. **Password Storage:**
   The review expressly points out that storing passwords in plaintext is a significant security risk, and suggested using bcrypt for secure password storage.
   **Score: 2/2**

7. **Password Storage:**  
   The review expressly points out that the passwords arestored in plain text, which is highly insecure, and suggested using bcrypt for secure password storage.  
   **Score: 2/2**
8. **Password Storage:**  
   The review points out plain text password storage in database and recommended using bcrypt for secure password storage.
   **Score: 2/2**

9. **Password Storage:**  
   The review points out passwords are stored in plain text without hashing and recommended using bcrypt for secure password storage.
   **Score: 2/2**
10. **Password Storage:**  
    The review points out passwords are stored in plain text in the database and recommends using bcrypt for secure password storage.
    **Score: 2/2**

This updated review is ideal because it comprehensively identifies major security and design flaws, including authentication, configuration, and error handling, while still providing clear, actionable recommendations, making it significantly more useful than an incomplete review that overlooks critical issues.
