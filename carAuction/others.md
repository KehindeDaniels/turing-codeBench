The JWT verification logic is duplicated in multiple routes. This repetition can lead to inconsistencies and maintenance challenges. Instead, use middleware to centralize token authentication and role checking.

Not having a central auth middleware causes code duplication and inconsistent routes. 2. Without a unified middleware handling authentication, code is repeated unnecessarily and may lead to inconsistent behavior. This is not addressed in the code review.

3. Authentication code duplication exists due to missing centralized middleware, creating maintenance issues and potential inconsistencies.

4. The absence of middleware-based authentication centralization causes redundant code and risks introducing inconsistencies.

5. By not implementing a centralized authentication middleware, the codebase suffers from duplication and potential authentication inconsistencies.
6. Multiple route handlers like `/api/bid/:carId` and `markSold` contain duplicate JWT verification code, creating potential inconsistencies. Implement a centralized authentication middleware instead.

7. The token verification logic appears redundantly across endpoints such as `/api/bid/:carId` and `markSold`. To improve maintainability, extract this into a shared middleware function.

8. Rather than repeating JWT authentication in each route (`/api/bid/:carId`, `markSold`), implement a reusable middleware to handle token verification consistently.

9. Token validation code is currently duplicated between `/api/bid/:carId` and `markSold` routes. Refactor this into middleware to ensure consistent authentication handling.

10. The same JWT verification appears in multiple places (`/api/bid/:carId` and `markSold` endpoints). Move this to a middleware layer to eliminate duplication and maintain consistency.
