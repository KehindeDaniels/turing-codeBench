Below is the updated prompt that reflects all of the introduced bugs and added complexity:

**Prompt:**

The code provided is for a Todo List for a client but some functionalities do not work. The code doesn't work as required due to multiple bugs. The bugs range from incorrect property handling, faulty id generation, improper data type usage, and flawed array management to additional issues with the extended functionalities. Specifically:

- **TodoItem Class:**
  - The property `desc` is used instead of `description`, causing inconsistency in property naming.
  - The `isComplete` property is set to the string `"false"` instead of a boolean `false`.
  - The `markComplete` method uses the equality operator (`==`) instead of the assignment operator (`=`), so the completion status is never updated.
  - The `markIncomplete` method similarly assigns the string `"false"` rather than the boolean value.
  - The new methods `updateDueDate` and `updatePriority` lack proper type validation and consistency, potentially leading to invalid due dates or priority values.

- **TodoList Class:**
  - The `addItem` method uses the array length as the id, which can lead to id collisions if items are removed.
  - It incorrectly pushes only the TodoItem's description (a string) into the `todoItems` array instead of the complete TodoItem object.
  - The `removeItem` method uses incorrect loop conditions and an assignment operator within its if condition, causing it to remove or even access the wrong items.
  - The methods `completeItem`, `getIncompleteItems`, `updateItem`, and `findItem` operate on an array that may not contain the proper TodoItem objects due to the flawed `addItem` implementation.
  - A new method, `sortByPriority`, is introduced but may fail when encountering invalid item types or missing properties.

- **ExtendedTodoList Class:**
  - The `duplicateItem` method duplicates an item but does not generate a new unique id, resulting in duplicate ids.
  - The `clearCompleted` method uses an assignment operator instead of a comparison operator, potentially deleting the wrong items and corrupting array indices.
  - The `countItems` method incorrectly references a non-existent `count` property instead of returning the length of the `todoItems` array.

Additionally, there are validation issues, logging inconsistencies, and type coercion problems throughout the code.

Please review the implementation and fix all the bugs. Ensure that each method behaves as expected, maintains data consistency, and that the unit tests (provided in the stack trace below) pass successfully. Provide a corrected version of the code along with an updated unit test suite that fully validates the functionality of the Todo List system.
