-The review should point out that the custom body parser logic (`req.on('data', function(chunk) { ... }`) is unnecessary, as Express already provides a built-in middleware (`express.json()`) for handling JSON bodies. Removing this custom logic will simplify the code and reduce potential security risks.

- The review should point out that the application does not implement any rate limiting on API endpoints. This will lead to abuse, like spamming job creation requests, overwhelming the server and degrading performance.

- The review should point out that the application does not implement authentication or authorization for job management endpoints. Anyone can create, query, or delete jobs.

- The review should point out that the application does not handle Redis connection errors. If Redis is unavailable, the job queue might fail silently, causing issues in the application.

- The review should point out that querying job states multiple times (`getWaiting`, `getActive`, `getCompleted`, `getFailed`) is inefficient and would impact performance with large job queues. A batched or cached query approach would be more optimal.

- The review should point out that error responses across the endpoints are inconsistent. For example, some endpoints return string error messages, while others return JSON objects. A consistent error response format should be adopted to improve clarity and consistency.

- The review should point out that Redis connection details (the host and port) are hardcoded in the application. and recommend using environment variable for flexibility and security

- The review should point out that the API endpoints do not validate or sanitize incoming request data. Not validating or sanitizing input data could lead to security vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks or incorrect data processing.
