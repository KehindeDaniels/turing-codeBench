Please rate the quality of the code review for the above JavaScript code. The reviewer was asked to look especially for things like this:

- Bad practices
- Security vulnerabilities
- Clear inefficiencies
- Bugs

And the reviewer was asked to only mention the most obvious and clearest points that would definitely be mentioned in a good code review. Here is what we are looking for:

- The code review should point out that Error messages are being directly sent to the client (`err` in error responses) exposing sensitive system information

- The review should point out that the application does not implement any rate limiting on API endpoints. This will lead to abuse, like spamming job creation requests, overwhelming the server and degrading performance.

- The review should point out that the application does not implement authentication or authorization for job management endpoints. Anyone can create, query, or delete jobs.

- The review should point out that the application does not handle Redis connection errors. If Redis is unavailable, the job queue might fail silently, causing issues in the application.

- The review should point out that querying job states multiple times (`getWaiting`, `getActive`, `getCompleted`, `getFailed`) is inefficient and would impact performance with large job queues. A batched or cached query approach would be more optimal.

- The review should point out that error responses across the endpoints are inconsistent. For example, some endpoints return string error messages, while others return JSON objects. A consistent error response format should be adopted to improve clarity and consistency.

- The review should point out that the route organization is poorly structured, and the application should utilize an Express Router to effectively manage endpoints

- The review should point out that Redis connection details (the host and port) are hardcoded in the application. and recommend using environment variable for flexibility and security

Each of these is worth a maximum of 2 points, for a total of 16 points. Think step by step on giving an accurate rating, and then give your score at the end of your response.
