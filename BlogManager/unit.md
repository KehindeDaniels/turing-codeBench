Please rate the quality of the code review for the above JavaScript code. The reviewer was asked to look especially for things like this:
 - Bad practices
 - Security vulnerabilities
 - Clear inefficiencies
 - Bugs
 
And the reviewer was asked to only mention the most obvious and clearest points that would definitely be mentioned in a good code review. Here is what we are looking for:

- The code review should point out that the `generateId` method uses basic random strings without checking if IDs already exist. For a blog with many posts, it should use a better way to create unique IDs.

- The code review should point out that the application does not include authorization checks for operations such as publishing or updating posts.

- The code review should point out that the application allows direct exposure of internal data (`internalNotes`) without proper access controls.

- The code review should point out that the application lacks rate-limiting on operations like search, making it susceptible to abuse

- The code review should point out that the app uses blocking operations instead of asynchronous I/O with async/await.

- The code review should point out that debug mode logging exposes sensitive data like post details and SQL queries to the console, which is risky in production.

- The code review should point out that the application does not enforce maximum post limits, leading to potential resource exhaustion.


- The code review should point out that API key and database credentials are hardcoded in the constructor. These should be moved to environment variables or a secure configuration management system.

Each of these is worth a maximum of 2 points, for a total of 16 points. Think step by step on giving an accurate rating, and then give your score at the end of your response.
