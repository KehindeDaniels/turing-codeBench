	1.	The code review should point out that the application hardcodes sensitive credentials instead of using secure environment variables.
	2.	The code review should point out that the application constructs SQL queries via string concatenation instead of using parameterized queries.
	3.	The code review should point out that the application generates post IDs with Math.random() instead of using a cryptographically secure method.
	4.	The code review should point out that the application performs blocking synchronous operations rather than utilizing asynchronous I/O with async/await.
	5.	The code review should point out that the application does not validate and sanitize user inputs before storing or using them.
	6.	The code review should point out that the application lacks proper error handling and propagation mechanisms in database operations.
	7.	The code review should point out that the application logs sensitive information in debug mode instead of using secure logging practices.
	8.	The code review should point out that the application uses an in-memory store for posts instead of a scalable database solution.
	9.	The code review should point out that the application does not enforce maximum post limits, leading to potential resource exhaustion.
	10.	The code review should point out that the application performs SQL queries synchronously, which can block the event loop and degrade performance.
	11.	The code review should point out that the application lacks rate-limiting on operations like search, making it susceptible to abuse.
	12.	The code review should point out that the application does not implement pagination in search results, potentially impacting performance.
	13.	The code review should point out that the application allows direct exposure of internal data (e.g., internalNotes) without proper access controls.
	14.	The code review should point out that the application does not include authorization checks for operations such as publishing or updating posts.
	15.	The code review should point out that the application omits audit logging and versioning, which are essential for tracking changes and ensuring data integrity.
	16.	The code review should point out that there is no validation for Maximum number of posts reached
	17.		The code review should point out that there is no input validation

    - The review should note that `deletePost` returns inconsistent values: "deleted" on success but "Post does not exist" on failure, while other methods throw errors instead
