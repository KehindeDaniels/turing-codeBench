This solution is incorrect for the folowing reason
- When processing notifications one by one, the same cache is used for all of them. After the first notification is processed and saved in the cache, later ones are wrongly marked as duplicates. This happens because their keys are the same or get mixed up. Because of this, only the first notification gets sent.

- The test expects notifications with different case (like "User4" vs "user4") to be treated as different. The code converts userId to string but keeps case. Getting 3 calls instead of 2 means that a notification is processed twice. This happens because the cache key isn't handled consistently

- When running notifications at the same time using Promise.all, some promises may never finish. This can happen when
  - The cache doesn't properly check for duplicates due to timing issues
  - The random delays from setTimeout don't work right with Jest's fake timers
When this happens, Promise.all gets stuck waiting and the test times out


- The code checks for arrays but doesn't always stop when they are empty (like in the concurrent part), causing extra logs empty arrays are not handled right, so notifications get sent when they should not



- The `processNotifications` method is async. When it finds bad input, it returns a failed promise instead of throwing an error right away. The test tries to catch errors normally, but misses the promise error. 



- When running notifications at the same time, the promises never finish. This happens because the cache is shared between notifications but not properly synced. This means some promises never resolve, causing `Promise.all` to get stuck waiting.
