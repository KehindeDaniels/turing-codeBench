1. The application uses hardcoded values for both the server port (2200) and Redis connection settings, but this isn't addressed in the review.

2. Hardcoded configuration values, including port 2200 and Redis connection parameters, were not mentioned in the review findings.

3. The code review overlooked the presence of hardcoded values - specifically the server port (2200) and default Redis connection settings.

4. Despite containing hardcoded server port (2200) and Redis connection configurations, these issues weren't highlighted in the review.

5. The review failed to identify that both the server port (2200) and Redis connection parameters are hardcoded in the application.

6. The API is missing essential security controls, leaving leaderboard data vulnerable to unauthorized access and modifications, but this security gap wasn't covered in the review.

7. The review did not point out missing security controls that could stop unauthorized users from changing leaderboard data.

8. The review overlooked a critical security flaw where the API provides unrestricted access to leaderboard data without any authentication or access control mechanisms.

9. A significant security vulnerability exists in the API where leaderboard data can be accessed and modified without proper authorization, yet this wasn't identified during the review process.

10. The absence of security controls in the API exposes leaderboard data to potential unauthorized access and manipulation, though this security risk wasn't mentioned in the review findings.
