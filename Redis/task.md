Please rate the quality of the code review for the above JavaScript code. The reviewer was asked to look especially for things like this:

- Bad practices
- Security vulnerabilities
- Clear inefficiencies
- Bugs

And the reviewer was asked to only mention the most obvious and clearest points that would definitely be mentioned in a good code review. Here is what we are looking for:

- The code review should point out that the server port (2200), Redis connection defaults, are hardcoded.

- The code review should point out the API lacks any security measures to restrict access, allowing unauthorized users to modify or access leaderboard data.

- The code review should point out that directly using query parameters (`req.query.player`) in Redis commands without any sanitization wil lead to injection attacks and issues with malformed inputs.

- The code review should say that the API needs rate limiting to stop too many requests and prevent abuse that could crash the service.

- The code review should point out that there is no reconnection strategy for the Redis client if the connection is lost during operation, which will cause the service to become unexpectedly unavailable.

- The code review should point out that there are Asynchronous operations in the `/add-score` endpoint, `redisClient.zAdd()` tha is not awaited, leading to race conditions and data inconsistencies.

- The code review should point out that the `/top-players` endpoint defaults to returning 100,000 records with no limit or pagination is provided, leading to performance bottlenecks and excessive resource usage.

- The code review should point out that there is no mechanism to close the Redis connection when the server shuts down, which can lead to resource leakage over time.

Each of these is worth a maximum of 2 points, for a total of 16 points. Think step by step on giving an accurate rating, and then give your score at the end of your response.
