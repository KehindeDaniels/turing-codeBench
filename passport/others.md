This updated review points out several issues with the code that were missed in the incorrect review. The review correctly identifies the following issues:

- Passwords are stored as plain text. This is very unsafe. Use bcrypt to hash and salt passwords instead.

- Login routes don't have rate limiting. This lets attackers try many passwords quickly. Add express-rate-limit to stop this.

- There's no CSRF protection. This lets attackers make fake requests. Add csurf middleware to prevent this.

- Failed logins redirect to wrong pages. This confuses users. Fix redirects to go to proper error pages.

- Missing important security headers. Add Helmet middleware and set up CORS properly to make the app safer.

- Cookie settings are unsafe. Enable secure, httpOnly and sameSite flags to protect session cookies.

- Login inputs aren't checked. This could let attackers inject bad code. Use express-validator or Joi to validate inputs.

This review covers key security issues for both login and general app security.
