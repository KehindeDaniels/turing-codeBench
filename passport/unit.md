Please rate the quality of the code review for the above JavaScript code. The reviewer was asked to look especially for things like this:

- Bad practices
- Security vulnerabilities
- Clear inefficiencies
- Bugs

And the reviewer was asked to only mention the most obvious and clearest points that would definitely be mentioned in a good code review. Here is what we are looking for:

- The code review should point out that plaintext password storage and comparison are used, and that passwords must be hashed and salted (for example, using bcrypt) to ensure security.
- The code review should point out that sensitive routes (like /login) lack rate limiting or brute-force protection, leaving them open to abuse.
- The code review should point out that HTTPS enforcement is missing, leaving data in transit vulnerable to interception.
- The code review should point out that CSRF protection is absent, exposing the application to cross-site request forgery attacks.
- The code review should point out that the failure redirect on the login route is misconfigured (redirecting to an undefined endpoint), which may cause user confusion or errors.
- The code review should point out that additional security middleware like Helmet for securing HTTP headers and proper CORS configuration is missing, reducing the overall security posture.
- The code review should point out that the session cookie is insecurely configured (with settings like secure: false), allowing cookies to be transmitted over non-HTTPS connections and requiring additional flags (httpOnly and sameSite) for production.
- The code review should point out that login inputs are not validated or sanitized, whcih can expose the application to injection attacks.

Each of these is worth a maximum of 2 points, for a total of 16 points. Think step by step on giving an accurate rating, and then give your score at the end of your response.
