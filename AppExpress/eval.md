- The code stores the password in plain text, which is a security risk.

- The `setInterval` function continuously adds new user entries (1000 every 100ms) to the Users array without any cleanup, leading to excessive memory consumption

- The `/redirect` endpoint accepts and processes URLs without validation, allowing potential redirects to malicious websites

- The `/admin` route lacks proper access control checks and the login endpoint returns HTTP 200 status code even for failed authentication attempts

- The JWT token is hardcoded in the code, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access

- Incomplete request parameter destructuring in login endpoint causing application errors


This review is missing some important problems

- No JSON parser middleware to handle JSON data properly
- Getting sensitive data through URL parameters instead of request body (not secure)
- Logging passwords and private information
- Wrong port number shown in logs
- Using fixed session secrets in the code

These issues need to be fixed to make the application more secure.
