- The code review should point out that middleware functions must call `next()` on all code paths to avoid hanging requests, as seen in the custom middleware that never calls `next()` when the “x-custom” header is not set.

- The review should point out that code that blocks the server, like the infinite loop in /records, needs to be fixed so the server keeps working.

- The review should point out that showing private config data through endpoints like `/config` is unsafe since it lacks proper auth checks.

- The review should point out that using deeply nested callbacks for reading patient records is bad practice and should use `async/await` or Promises instead for better code readability and error handling

- The review should point out that not having security middleware makes the system unsafe, which is very risky for a hospital system.

- The code review should point out that deprecated file system methods, such as `fs.exists` in the `/deprecated` endpoint, should be replaced with `fs.access` or `fs.promises.access` which are the current best practices for checking file existence

- The review should point out that header values like "x-custom" need to be checked and cleaned to stop security problems.

- The review should point out that showing private config data through endpoints like `/config` is unsafe since it lacks proper auth checks.
