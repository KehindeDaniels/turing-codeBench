- The code review should point out that using eval in both `updatePaymentStatus()` and `validatePayment()` increases the risk of code injection, amd is unsafe 

- The code review should point out that `sendPayment` and `processRefund` use blocking loops that freeze the thread 

- The code review should point out that the `payments` and `transactionHistory` arrays have no cleanup mechanism, which risks memory overflow 

- The code review should point out that API keys is hardcoded in the source code 

- The code review should point out that `sendPayment` does not use the provided payment details, gateway URL and API key parameters

- The code review should point out that using fixed refund IDs ("RFND) and non-unique transaction IDs can cause ID conflicts.

- The code review should point out that the card number validation regex incorrectly restricts input to a single digit and lacks the `.test()` method for proper validation

- The code review should point out that using inconsistent timestamp formats (Date objects and ISO strings) cause data consistency issues.
