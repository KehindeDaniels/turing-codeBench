Here are some of the issues found in the `PaymentProcessingSystem`:
1. Security Issues:
- Using `eval()` to parse dates and status is unsafe, it executes arbitrary JavaScript code, and allows code injection attacks
- Card numbers and `CVV` are not encrypted, they stored as plain text, this is not safe
- The API key is written directly in code instead of being stored safely in environment settings

2. Data Integrity and Validation:
- Card number validation regex is incorrect and missing .test() method
- There is no check if the transaction IDs are unique, and this could lead to duplicate records
- The refund ID is hardcoded as "RFND", which makes it impossible to track each refund separately
- The date formats are inconsistent, some use ISO strings, some use timestamps, making it hard to compare dates correctly

3. Implementation Issues:
- The `sendPayment()` function is not using the provided payment details, `gatewayUrl` or `API key`
- In the `processPayment()` methoc, validatePayment() is called twice for the same payment, which is unnecessary and will slows down the system
- Status code mismatch between processPayment (expects 200) and sendPayment (returns 201)
- Blocking busy-wait loops (like `while Date.now() - start < 500`) prevent other code from executing by occupying the JavaScript event loop, causing poor performance and system unresponsiveness

4. Memory Management:
- `Payments` and `transactionHistory` arrays continuously grow as new transactions are added, and there is no mechanism to remove or archive old records, which could lead to excessive memory usage and leak since all transaction data is kept indefinitely in memory
- As arrays grow larger, operations like searching and filtering will become slower

To address these issues, the code should:
- Replace `eval()` with proper date parsing and status conversion methods
- Implement proper encryption for sensitive data
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Implement unique ID generation and validation
- Add proper payment gateway integration
- Implement data cleanup mechanism
