- The review should point out that the API key and gateway URL are hard-coded, which is a major security vulnerability. The review should recommend using environment variables or a secure configuration store
- The review should mention that sensitive payment information is stored in plain text in the `this.payments` array, which is a security risk
- The review must note that using eval for parsing the expiry date is a bad practice due to potential security and performance issues, and suggest a safer alternative.
- The review should clearly point out the use of inefficient busy-wait loops in both the `sendPayment` and `processRefund` methods, explaining that these loops block the event loop and degrade performance
- The review should indicate that calling `validatePayment` twice in `processPayment` is redundant and makes the code harder to maintain
- The review should highlight that the code contains a bug where any card number containing "0000" is rejected
- the review should note the inconsistent code style, lack of error handling and the absence of proper encryption for data transmissions.






Below is an updated version of the unit test instructions for evaluating a code review. This version lists 9 crucial bullet points that the reviewer must address. Each point is worth up to 2 points (for a total of 18 points, but you can scale as needed):

- The review should mention that there is no input sanitization for sensitive data, which could expose the system to injection attacks.
- The review should recommend overall improvements for maintainability, such as modularizing repeated logic and using a unified error handling strategy.
