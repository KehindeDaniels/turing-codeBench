- The review failed to identify that using `eval()` to parse expiry dates is unsafe and could run harmful code if input is not cleaned
- It also did not identify security risk where `eval()` converts status strings, which could let attackers run any code

- The review missed that dates are handled differently in different places, some use ISO strings, some use timestamps, and some use custom formats. This makes it hard to compare dates correctly.

- The review failed to identify that the `sendPayment()` function ignores the payment details passed to it, making the API integration non-functional. The `gatewayUrl` and API key parameters are defined but never used in the actual payment processing.

- The review did not catch that using "RFND" as a fixed refund ID makes it impossible to track each refund separately, the code does not check if transaction IDs are unique, which could create duplicate records.

- The review missed that the code keeps adding data to payments and `transactionHistory` arrays without ever removing old records. This wastes memory and can slow down or crash the app over time.

- The review failed to identify that sensitive payment details like the CVV and card number are stored in plain text rather than being encrypted or securely handled, creating a security risk if the data is compromised.
